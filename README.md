# LHA capstone project

The LHA project is a simple bank account game within the CLI.  

Bank account functions
- check balance
- add funds
- remove funds

The addition to the bank account is that the bank cannot be zero. When the account should be zero, the overage is moved to an overage account. 
The overage is collected over the next 6o days.
